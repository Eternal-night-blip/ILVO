# Welcome to ILVO Plan
## Brief
ILVO (Immerse Learners in Vocabulary originally) is Learners' Voice Organization. It's a maching-aided Language Learning project that gathers collective wisdom and feeds back humanity. It's not merely a project,but also a software,still more is a set of technical standards for machine-assisted language learning.The idea of ILVO is sharing, immersion, freedom and visualization. 

Now ILVO just supports English which is ILVO's starting at.

Sharing means that all resources under the ILVO program are freely available, and users are also researchers who can construct new data sources or applications.

Immersion is about helping users learn efficiently and actively. 

Freedom manifests that users can customize their own learning plans and learning methods in a comparatively high degree. Meanwhile,students can choose individual software to achieve privacy and security fundamentally. 

Visualization illustrates that learning results can be visually presented to users, and presented mainly in two ways: data source with graph structure and data statistics chart to help users track their patterns of learning in a more proper way.

The project features and points of innovations are as follows:

1. This project is based on the ILVO plan, which is a solution for English vocabulary learning which gathers community wisdom and realizes the four major concepts of ILVO.

2. Provide brand-new learning mechanism, reviewing mechanism and feedback mechanism.

3. Provide embellishment services based on the levels of syntax and semantics.

4. Support users to use ILVO on both mobile terminal and web terminal; support both networking and individual modes as well.

5. Allow students to modify, thus they are able to create their own learning graph and recommend sharing results to others.
